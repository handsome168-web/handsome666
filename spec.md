Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is expect to relate to the SARS virus closely. Cases were initially identified in Wuhan, capital of Hubei province in China, in December 2019. Cases reported outside of China have predominantly been related to people who have recently travelled to Mainland China. However, a few cases of local transmission have also occurred. Tentatively, our Line bot will achieve the following three features to help fight and control this epidemic.
1. Through inquiry about some symptoms, you can preliminarily assess whether you have caught the virus. Some effective measures to prevent the disease, and medical guidelines should also be advised. 
2. By entering the address, you can query the local epidemic situation, including confirmed cases, suspected cases, cured cases, death cases, and the Line bot will recommend to you some nearest public hospitals. 
3. The bot will display transportation details where infected cases had taken and users can query whether there is a case for public transportation on a certain shift.
